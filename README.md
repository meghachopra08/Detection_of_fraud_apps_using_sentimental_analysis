# Detection_of_fraud_apps_using_sentimental_analysis
Performed Sentiment Analysis on reviews of different apps on Google Play Store.
## Business Value:
Sentiment analysis or opinion mining, is to analyze some textual documents and predict their sentiment or opinion based on the content of the document. Sentiment analysis is perhaps one of the most popular applications of natural language processing and text analytics with a vast number of websites, books and tutorials on this subject. Typically sentiment analysis seems to work best on subjective text, where people express opinions, feelings, and their mood. From a real-world industry standpoint, sentiment analysis is widely used to analyze corporate surveys, feedback surveys, social media data, and reviews for movies, places, commodities, and many more. The idea is to ensure that clients receive appropriate and accurate feedback before installing the app so it becomes critical to avoid difficulties. 
## Problem Statement:
A problem statement for our project is the discovery of emotionally charged fraudulent applications analysis. We developed an emotion analysis-based machine learning model.
## Data Overview
We scraped reviews of 41 popular mobile apps and manually labelled each data as positive or negative to create the dataset.
## Model
The Naive Bayes algorithm was used to classify the applications in this project. We're working on a system that detects fraud applications using sensitive commentary and data processing.
